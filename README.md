# Artificial-Intelligence
includes problems:
- missionaries and cannibals (in Python)
- wolf, goat, cabbage (in Python)
- map colorng (in Prolog)
- 4 heuristics(missplaced, manhattan distance, euclidian distance, missplaced rows and collums) for 8-puzzle problem(in Python)
- Map search problem for n random cities. Having n cities and m roads, find the shortest
path in order to reach city B from city A. Let us assume that each city is given
by its coordinates.
Develop implementations and two heuristic functions for each A* and
Recursive-Best-First-Search algorithms using a programming language of your
choice.
Develop an application that allows you to test and evaluate your algorithm
implementation.
