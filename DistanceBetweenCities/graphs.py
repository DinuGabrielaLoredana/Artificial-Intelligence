    have a length associated with it.  The constructor call is something like:
        g = Graph({'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 2})
    this makes a graph with 3 nodes, A, B, and C, with an edge of length 1 from
    A to B,  and an edge of length 2 from A to C.  You can also do:
        g = Graph({'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 2}, directed=False)
    This makes an undirected graph, so inverse links are also added. The graph
    stays undirected; if you add more links with g.connect('B', 'C', 3), then
    inverse link is also added.  You can use g.nodes() to get a list of nodes,
    g.get('A') to get a dict of links out of A, and g.get('A', 'B') to get the
    length of the link from A to B.  'Lengths' can actually be any object at
