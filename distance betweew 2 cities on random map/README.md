Map search problem for n cities. Having n cities and m roads, nd the shortest
path in order to reach city B from city A. Let us assume that each city is given
by its coordinates.
Develop implementations and two heuristic functions for each A* and
Recursive-Best-First-Search algorithms using a programming language of your
choice.
Develop an application that allows you to test and evaluate your algorithm
implementation.
