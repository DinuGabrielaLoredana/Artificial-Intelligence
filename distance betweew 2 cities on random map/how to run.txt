The program will ask for the number of cities (which will then randomly be generated and put intoa graph)
The program will ask for the number of the start city which must be positive and lower than the number of cities
The program will ask for the number of the destination city which must be positive and lower than the number of cities

It will then generate the output as the solution and the time needed to compute the solution for each RBFS and A* with manhattan and 
euclidian heuristic. And it will generate a comparison between these by the number of succesors, states, and goal tests
